Denary; 
Also known as "decimal" or "base 10," is the standard number system used around the world. It uses ten digits (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9) to represent all numbers.

Binary;
In mathematics and digital electronics, a binary number is a number expressed in the base-2 numeral system or binary numeral system, which uses only two symbols: typically "0" (zero) and "1" (one).

The base-2 numeral system is a positional notation with a radix of 2. Each digit is referred to as a bit. Because of its straightforward implementation in digital electronic circuitry using logic gates, the binary system is used by almost all modern computers and computer-based devices.

So with this program we can convert binary number to denary or denary number to binary :)
